## Framework and Tool Parsers

- The name of the parser indicates the framework or tool as well as the expected results output data format.  HTML is not supported nor encouraged as a standardized data format.
- All framework and tool parsers listed here leverage the delivery scripts and UpdateQTestWithResults.js submission method found in this repository, except as noted in the next point.  See the 'delivery' and 'qtest' subdirectories for more information.
- Users leveraging the qTest Scenario Plugin for Jira will use UpdateQTestAndLinkScenarioRequirements.js instead to deliver results to qTest, link the Requirements with those brought in from Jira, and colorize Scenario steps in the Plugin.
- These actions are NOT compatible with the stock Pulse 9.1 BDD workflow rules as these rules incorporate standards and conventions not used in the stock rules.
- These actions are NOT compatible with the parsers included in Launch due to a difference between leveraged qTest backend API endpoints, however Pulse actions may be used in lieu of a Launch parser by skipping parser selection in the Universal Agent and shipping the results to the Pulse webhook endpoint instead.

### AllureXML.js
This parser will consume XML results from the Allure framework.  All items marked as test cases in the results files will be marked as test cases in qTest.

### CucumberJSON.js
This is a parser for Cucumber for Java 4.0+ JSON result files.  Required for the qTest Scenario workflow.

### CypressMochawesome.js
This parser consumes JSON results from the Cypress.io Mochawesome frameworks.  Ship the consolidated 'report.json' file to this parser.

### JUnitXML.js
This is a parser for JUnit XML result files.  It should also support XUnit, JBehave and JMeter result files.

### NUnitXML.js
This parser is for NUnit XML result files.  It reports tests at the method level, so there are no test steps.  Failures are annotated and attached to the test runs in qTest.

### PostmanJSON.js
This is a parser for Postman API endpoint test results output in JSON.  This is a more detailed parser than the one included with Launch, and thus not compatible with results already consumed by Launch.

### ReadyAPIXML.js
This is a parser for the XML output provided by the ReadyAPI testing tool.  Currently, expected results will be in a test suite and not individual tests.

### RobotXML.js
This will parse XML results from the Robot Framework.  Currently, it is a high-level parser and will only work a single non-nested suite of results.

### SonarQubeJSON.js
This is a parser for the SonarQube JSON format for code quality and assurance.  Leverage the webhook calls in SonarQube, please see this article to configure and review the expected format: https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/project-administration/webhooks/

### SpecflowTRX.js
This is a parser for legacy Tricents SpecFlow product TRX result files.  It does not support HTML report output, nor does it support the new XML output from later versions of SpecFlow.

### TestNGXML.js
This is a parser for TestNG XML results files.  It does not support Extent HTML reports.

### ToscaXML.js
This is a parser for Tricentis Tosca ToscaCI XML results files.  It parses the test steps from the non-standard plaintext tags inside the file.  It is not compatible with results already consumed by Launch or the native integration, and is meant for CI Pipeline usage only via ToscaCI.  It may require customization for your environment.
